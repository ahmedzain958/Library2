Whether to use a class or an interface?
 Strong is-a: a relationship that clearly describes a parent-child relationship
For example: a student is a person
Should be modeled using class inheritance


 Weak is-a (or is-kind-of): indicates that an object possesses
a certain property
 For example: all strings are comparable, all dates are
comparable
Should be modeled using interfaces
 You can also use interfaces to circumvent single inheritance
restriction if multiple inheritance is desired
