inheritance: relationship between classes that allow you to extend the behavior and the property of other classes.
    code reuse is often touted as the main benefit of inheritance. Typically, you think of one class inheriting from another
    if they share an IS-A relationship.

Disadvantages:
    It is easy to overdo inheritance and make it the basis of all your OOD,
    pay attention when all your classes are IS-A relationship, overusing inheritance will end-up
    with designs that are inflexible and difficult to change.
