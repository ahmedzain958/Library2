Interface: abstraction of a common behavior among set of classes, no need to have a relationship
- From my POV: interface allows different classes to share a same behavior not similar classes share a different behavior





abstract classes :  useful to force all its subclasses to implement that model and when the implementation
    of the superclass becomes invalid in the subclass

    An object cannot be created from abstract class:
    An abstract class cannot be instantiated using the new
    operator.
    We still define its constructors, which are invoked in the
    constructors of its subclasses through constructor
    chaining.
