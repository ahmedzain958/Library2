fragments represent a portion of UI in an activity, you can think of fragment as a modular section of an activity, has its own lifecycle, receives its own input events
which you can add or remove while the activity is running (subactiviy you can use accross differnt activities)


- Fragments should be modular
- Fragments should not be aware of each other
- Fragments should not launch other Fragments: if a click event happens in f1, it shouldn't trigger fragment 2 directly, it should communicate  the event to activity
