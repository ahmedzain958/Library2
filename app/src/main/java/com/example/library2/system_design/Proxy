Proxy: ex: when you don't talk to the broker directly and you tell your assistant(proxy) to talk instead

Think about a machine that sits between the client and server (talks to the server on behalf of client)

Forward Proxy: (can be seen as client-side proxy)
 - disguises a client's IP
 - used in institutions when multiple clients and all the traffic is controlled
 and monitored through forward proxy, used in case of blocking the access to certain site
 and used in case of caching the responses

Reverse Proxy:(can be seen as server-side proxy) sits on server side and acts as a middle man for all the servers

Client talks to the proxy and the proxy talks to all the servers and gets back all responses to the client,
In this case there is anonymity of server, the client doesn't know about the ip addresses of any of the servers
It only knows about the proxy

- Scrubs all incoming traffic before it is sent to our backend
- Caches response from servers
- efficiently distributes the load for applications using mulitple servers
- mitigates the perilous attacks, because actually your servers aren't exposed to the outer-world
- provides single configuration point to manage SSL/TSL

Important element for security, privacy and handling the traffic
