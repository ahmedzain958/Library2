Logical Entities:

- Data: stays at the crux of all the systems and saved in databases
- Application: How people some way interact/get data from the database

- Communication Protocol: Lets think of database as a part of code that run on a machine and applicaton is a part of code that runs on another
machine and they need to interact with each other and that happens through, makes communications between different
machines possible (TCP/HTTP/ICP,..)
Applications communicate with each other through requests in a form of APIs/RPC

- Presentation layer: systems may/may not have presentation layers, but the systems that do (Mobile apps, web apps)
    systems have no presentation layer like logging systems


All these components that we discussed run on some instances that are available by some cloud providers, these instances together come under the infrastructure requirements of the system
given by AWS, google cloud or azure
