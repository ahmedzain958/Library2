- Make the smallest unit in your code (function) plays just one role.
    ex: make a function to sum only not sum, subtract, divide and print
    which achieves the re-usability
- for a larger unit (class) must be responsible for just one responsibility,
    no need to make the class containing just one function
    all methods and attributes correlation/linkage/interconnection ترابط is very high and related to themselves
    ex: Calculator class => contains functions like sum, subtract, divide, power (all do calculations)
