DTO is an object that carries data between processes,
 The motivation for its use is that communication between processes is usually done resorting to remote interfaces (e.g., web services)

 The difference between the DTO and the business objects/DAO is that DTO doesn't have any behavior except
  for storage retrieval, serialization and deserialization of its own data (mutators, accessors, serializers and parsers)
 In other words, DTOs are simple objects that should not contain any business logic
  but may contain serialization and deserialization mechanisms for transferring data over the wire.[
