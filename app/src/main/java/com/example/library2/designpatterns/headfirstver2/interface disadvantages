We created a Flyable and quack-able interfaces which every client that quacks or flies implements
its behavioral interface.
Disadvantages: - every single duck will implement its own fly and quck method
- Worse, if there is any change came up to Flyable or Quack-able and we have 48 duck classes,
 we will go through all the classes and change the implementation

1- Destroys code reusability.
2- maintenance nightmare
3- no runtime changes allowed
