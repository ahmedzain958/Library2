- Only one instance of a certain class throughout the application or domain
- Only a single point of access for a resource (database access, network manager, logging, utility class)

ex:
 If we have multiple components and they need network communication to access network

 component 1 ------------------> network communication instance 1 -----------> network
 component 2 ------------------> network communication instance 2 -----------> network
 component 3 ------------------> network communication instance 3 -----------> network

Disadvantages of this approach:
these network communication instances communicate in different ways or you might have delays or you might order your communication in some way
so Ideally we need to create one instance and apply all our configurations on this instance like logging, ordering and all requests go through it
there is something that you could do with a single one that you couldn't do with multiple
