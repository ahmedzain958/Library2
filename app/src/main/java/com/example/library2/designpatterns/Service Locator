The Service Locator is a design pattern (some would argue antipattern) often used in software development to manage dependencies between objects.
 It acts as a central registry where objects can locate and access their dependencies. However, it is considered an antipattern
in certain contexts due to its negative impact on maintainability, testability, and the clarity of the code.



Problems with the Service Locator
Hidden dependencies: The Service Locator pattern can make dependencies between objects less clear, as they are not explicitly passed through constructors or setter methods.
Testability issues: The use of a Service Locator can make unit testing more difficult, as it is harder to provide mock objects or isolate dependencies for testing.
Inflexibility: The Service Locator pattern can make it challenging to change or replace dependencies, as they are managed centrally, rather than being passed as arguments.
Because it is typically implemented using a static reference to the service locator, this pattern exhibits many of the same problems as the static cling antipattern.
Alternatives
Dependency Injection: An alternative to the Service Locator pattern is Dependency Injection (DI), where dependencies are explicitly provided to objects through constructors or setter methods.
 DI makes dependencies more transparent, improving maintainability and testability.
Factory Pattern: The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class,
allowing subclasses to determine which objects to create. This pattern can be used to manage dependencies by encapsulating the creation of dependent objects within specific factory classes.
By doing so, you maintain separation of concerns and improve the modularity of the code.
